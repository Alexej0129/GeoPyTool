## Introduction


GeoPython is an application based on Python and designed as a solution for geology related daily work. **It can run on alomost all mainstream operating systems**, such as Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8, Windows 10, macOS Sierra, macOS High Sierra, Ubuntu Linux, Debian Linux, Fedora Linux, and alomost all other widely used desktop platforms.

**GeoPython doesn't rely on any other software**, such as MS Excel or CorelDraw, it can directly transport your data into the plot as vector graphic files and the calculation results into data sheets such as Xlsx or CSV files.


It is a **free software**: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

GeoPython contains both traditional routines and newly developed methods, which are shown in the table [here](https://github.com/chinageology/GeoPython/wiki/Functions).
