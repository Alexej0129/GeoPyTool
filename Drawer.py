This file is a module of TAS-plot for volcanic rocks.
All data used in this module are from the book 
"Igneous Rocks_ a Classification and Glossary of Terms"
 by  R.W. Le Maitre & International Union of Geological Sciences 2002
Texts below is cited from this book as an introduction of TAS-plot:
"The TAS (Total Alkali â€“ Silica) classification should be used only if:
(1) the rock is considered to be volcanic
(2) a mineral mode cannot be determined, owing either to the presence of glass or to the fine-grained nature of the rock
(3) a chemical analysis of the rock is available."
